# Aquicore

This project involves evaluation of the present scenario and future prospects of Aquicore
along with the Commercial Real Estate industry.
The basis of evaluation are Frameworks such as VRIN and Porter's five forces.

After a through analysis, 
we have provided a verdict on whether to buy, sell or, if you already own it, hold Aquicore stock.

The repository contains two files.
The first one is the power point presentation that we, my team and I, gave in front of an audience of 70 people.
The second one is the detailed project report of the same analysis.
